# Definition of done / Review checklist
 - Code compiles without any new warnings (it has to be well documented - why it occurs and reason why it is not fixed - to be left)
 - Code runs without any hard faults
 - All tests passes
 - No magic values - if one appears it has to be explained
 - Code is easily extendable and understandable
 - Code utilizes design patterns
